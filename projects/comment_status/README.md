### This is the solution for contest "Classify the user's comment" on https://www.aivivn.com/contests/1
#### Problem:
All comments here are collected from some ecommerce sites. Each comment will have status is positive(1) or negative(0). We need to build a model to learning these data and predict whether a new comment postive or negative.
#### Data Decription: 
We have two files **data/train.crash** and **data/test.crash**. The file **train.crash** contain comment and its status(1 is positive or 0 is negative). The file **test.crash** contain comment, we need to use this file and predict its status(positive or negative). All predict results from **test.crash** file will be saved in *.csv file with format as below: <br/>
id,label <br/>
test_000000,0 <br/>
test_000001,1 <br/>
test_000002,0 <br/>
.....



```python
