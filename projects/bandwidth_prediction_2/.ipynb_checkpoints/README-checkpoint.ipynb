    "## Predict server's bandwidth and number of users\n",
    "### Problem:\n",
    "A company providing entertainment platform that allows users to use music, video, live stream, chat services, etc. The company system is divided into zones according to geographical area. To meet the growing number of users, the company wants to predict the total bandwidth of each server and the maximum number of concurrent users accessing the server within the next month to plan operations.\n",
    "See more detail on link: https://www.aivivn.com/contests/5\n",
    "### Data Decription:\n",
    "#### Training data\n",
    "Training data (file train.csv) includes more than 35 thousand rowa. Here are the first five rows.\n",

    "## Final Solution\n",
    "Base on these algorithm above, we see the KNN Regression and Random Forest have high percent of accuracy. Therfore, we build some final solutions to predict maxUser and bandwidth.\n",
